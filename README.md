#  Insurance Claims Detection

This Project consist of detection of claims where target variable consist of 1 and 0. 
### Challange
Data was Imbalanced with claims made as target variable 1 with size= 21k, no claims as target variable 0 with size 570k. It was a challanging part to balance the data or use equivaent data to predict about claims.

### Data Preporcession incluses:
* Smoting
* One hot Encoding
* Scaling


### Use of ML Models such as:
* PCA
* SVM
* Logistic Regression
* XG Boost
* Ada Boost
* Random Forest
* Keras
* Artificial Neural Network
* Catboost
* LightGBM
